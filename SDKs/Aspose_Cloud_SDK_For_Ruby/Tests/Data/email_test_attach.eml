Aspose Cloud SDK Bundle
The goal of this bundle is to provide an easy way to integrate the Aspose Cloud SDK into a Symfony2 project.

1. Installation 
AsposeCloudsdkBundle can be installed via Composer. Add the following to your composer.json file:
"aspose/cloud-sdk-bundle": "dev-master"

Then, you can install the new dependencies by running Composer's update command from the directory where your composer.json file is located:
composer.update

Now, Composer will automatically download all required files, and install them for you. All that is left to do is to update your AppKernel.php file, and register the new bundle:
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
    {
    // ...
     new Aspose\Bundle\CloudBundle\AsposeCloudBundle(),
    // ...
);
}

2. Usage
AsposeCloudsdkBundle is called as a standard service.
$this->get('asposeapp');
This will return you object of Product class and you can access properties and methods of class.

3. License
This bundle is under the MIT license. See the complete license in the bundle:
