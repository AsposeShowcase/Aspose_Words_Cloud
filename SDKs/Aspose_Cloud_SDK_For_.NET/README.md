  <h3>Aspose Cloud SDK for .NET Repository</h3>
  <p>Aspose Cloud SDK for .NET is an open source software development kit that makes it super simple to call Aspose Cloud APIs. We are pleased to announce a new totally revamped and greatly improved version. This version of the SDK is designed to work like a product. Now you can simply create an instance of any supported Cloud API service and then call its methods with a single line of code. All the complex authentication, request and response manipulation is seamlessly handled in the back-end.</p>
